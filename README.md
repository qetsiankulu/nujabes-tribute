This project is a responsive website paying homage to Jun Seba aka Nujabes. As a tribute to his immense contributions to the world of lofi music, I have created a platform that not only celebrates his legacy but also allows users to explore his music through an embedded media player powered by the Spotify API.

## Introduction

Nujabes left an indelible mark on the music industry, and this project serves as a digital memorial to honor his work. My website not only provides a platform to learn about his life and career but also allows users to listen to his music effortlessly through the embedded Spotify media player.

- **Tribute Section:** Learn about the life, achievements, and impact of Nujabes through a dedicated tribute section, complete with images and text.

- **Interactive UI:** The user interface is intuitive, making it easy for visitors to navigate the website, explore content, and play music.
